# PackageInstaller
Description
You suddenly have a curious aspiration to create a package installer that can handle
dependencies. You want to be able to give the installer a list of packages with dependencies,
and have it install the packages in order such that an install wonâ€™t fail due to a missing
dependency.
This exercise is to write the code that will determine the order of install.
